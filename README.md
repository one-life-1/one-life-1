  <h4>
    <p>Overview:</p>
  </h4>
  <p><b>CC_gen </b> is an online digital library of credit card design which enable users to view,
    download and make use of credit cards samples as a resources in their own project.
    It's easy to use library where design are displayed in a gallery format and categorised based on certain
    features. Users are able to sign up with unique username, create, personalise, manage, modify card
    design and save progress without losing their work of data.</p>
  <p>Among other use cases, this application is designed to give designers and developers access to resources to
    create web apps with credit card payment featuressuch as online payment applications, e-commerce stores, e.t.c

  <p><b>Design & Development</b></p>

  <p>The UI design, the frontend development, and the backend development</p>

  <p><b>The Design</b></p>

  <p>We are also implementing the desktop first design, as we believe most people who would want to use the

  <p><b>The Backend</b></p>
  <p>The Django framework is used to create and operate CC_Gen. It is a Python-based web framework that uses

  <P>
    Although it's not necessary to be familiar with the Django framework to use this web application, it might

## `Overview`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `npm install`
This installs the dependencies in the boilerplate.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Add More

You can add as many dependencies as you want and build your project.
